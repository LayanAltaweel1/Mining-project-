# Diabetes Health Project

**Status:** Phase 1 (Project Initiation & Data Exploration)

---

## Project Information
* **[span_0](start_span)[span_1](start_span)Project Description:** This project focuses on applying advanced data mining techniques to a comprehensive diabetes health dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing the disease[span_0](end_span)[span_1](end_span). [span_2](start_span)The core objective is to formalize a predictive and analytical framework by executing two primary data mining tasks: **classification and clustering**[span_2](end_span). [span_3](start_span)[span_4](start_span)We will utilize classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, to build a model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on clinical and lifestyle indicators[span_3](end_span)[span_4](end_span). Simultaneously, clustering techniques like K-means will be employed to group individuals into distinct health profiles, revealing hidden similarities in patient characteristics.
* **[span_5](start_span)[span_6](start_span)Project Motivation:** The motivation for this study stems from the critical need for early diabetes detection to prevent severe, long-term health complications such as cardiovascular disease and renal failure[span_5](end_span)[span_6](end_span). [span_7](start_span)Given the widespread nature of this chronic condition, leveraging data-driven insights provides a vital diagnostic aid for healthcare professionals[span_7](end_span). [span_8](start_span)[span_9](start_span)[span_10](start_span)By identifying key risk factors—ranging from BMI and blood pressure to lifestyle habits—this project aims to demonstrate how automated data analysis can enhance early intervention strategies[span_8](end_span)[span_9](end_span)[span_10](end_span).
