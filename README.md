#Diabetes Health Project

Project Description: This project focuses on applying advanced data mining techniques to a comprehensive diabetes health dataset to uncover patterns and factors influencing the disease. The core objective is to formalize a predictive and analytical framework by executing two primary data mining tasks: classification and clustering. We will utilize classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, to build a model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on clinical and lifestyle indicators. Simultaneously, clustering techniques like K-means will be employed to group individuals into distinct health profiles, revealing hidden similarities in patient characteristics.  
Project Motivation: The motivation for this study stems from the critical need for early diabetes detection to prevent severe, long-term health complications such as cardiovascular disease and renal failure. Given the widespread nature of this chronic condition, leveraging data-driven insights provides a vital diagnostic aid for healthcare professionals. By identifying key risk factors—ranging from BMI and blood pressure to lifestyle habits—this project aims to demonstrate how automated data analysis can enhance early intervention strategies and support more informed medical treatment decisions.
